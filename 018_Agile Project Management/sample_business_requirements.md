# Project Social

## Executive Summary

*Your executive summary should be pretty brief, under 3 paragraphs and should provide a concise summary of the purpose and contents of the rest of the document.  Explain to the reader what they will get from this document.*
CoderCamps is in need of a quality, innovative and/or quick to market web application that will allow "like minded" students to connect on projects. The application will improve communication and motivate student engagement with the platform. Students will be able to post and search project ideas and collaborate on solutions. Client is open to discussing features that will create a social environment, promote engagement, and improve communication.

## Business Objectives

*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project int he sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*
Project Social web application will allow students to connect with peers and participate in real time conversations about projects,  planning, coordinate work, and other information in a password protected environment. The system will capture information related to projects and users. Objectives for this project will include...
  * Login with credentials
  * User profiles
  * Post project ideas
  * User comments
  * Search for projects and users
  * Tagging


## Background

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*
CoderCamps has relied on Slack for students to communicate and connect.  Adding project oriented social environment is needed to help with the learning process.

## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*
Using CoderCamps website as a template guide, this project will be built in 2 phases.  The first phase will include a "quality quick to market" system that will include...
  * Creating a new User 
  * Login with credentials
  * Post project ideas
  * User comments
  * Search for projects and users.
  * Admin User for managing users and archiving project
  
The second phase will include innovative solutions that in enhance communication, promote engagement and create a more social environment. 

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*



## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
